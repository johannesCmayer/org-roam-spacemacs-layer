# org-roam-spacemacs-layer

**DO NOT USE THIS, just enable `org-roam` IN THE `.dspacemacs`, which has also version 2 by now, as described [here](https://develop.spacemacs.org/layers/+emacs/org/README.html#org-roam-support).**

Add a layer for org-roam V2 and supporting packages

This sets up [org-roam](https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam), [org-roam-bibtex](https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam-bibtex), [org-roam-timestamps](https://github.com/tefkah/org-roam-timestamps), [org-roam-ui](https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam-ui).

Place the contents of this repository into `~/.emacs.d/private/org-roam`, and add `org-roam` to the layers in your .spacemacs file. You need to remove the org layer in the .spacemacs file, or disable the org-roam V1 package that is included in the org layer.
