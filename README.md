# org-roam-spacemacs-layer
Add a layer for org-roam V2 and supporting packages

This sets up [org-roam](https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam), [org-roam-bibtex](https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam-bibtex), [org-roam-timestamps](https://github.com/tefkah/org-roam-timestamps), [org-roam-ui](https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam-ui).

Place the contents of this repository into `~/.emacs.d/private/org-roam`, and add org-roam to the layers in your .spacemacs file. You need to remove the org layer in the .spacemacs file, or disable the org-roam V1 package that is included in the org layer.
